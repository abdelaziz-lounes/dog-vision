# üê∂ Dog Breed Identification Using Transfer Learning and TensorFlow

This project leverages machine learning to identify various dog breeds. It is based on transfer learning using a pre-trained model from TensorFlow Hub and utilizes a dataset from the Kaggle Dog Breed Identification competition.

## Project Workflow

The project follows a standard TensorFlow/Deep Learning workflow:

1. **Data Acquisition and Preparation:**
   - Downloads the dataset from Kaggle and stores it locally.
   - Prepares the data by splitting it into training, validation, and testing sets.
   - Converts images into numerical tensors for model input.

2. **Model Selection and Training:**
   - Uses a pre-trained TensorFlow Hub model (`mobilenet_v2_130_224`) for transfer learning.
   - Builds a Keras model with an input layer based on the pre-trained model and an output layer for classification.
   - Compiles the model with appropriate loss functions, optimizers, and evaluation metrics.
   - Trains the model on the training data, utilizing callbacks for TensorBoard visualization and early stopping to prevent overfitting.

3. **Model Evaluation and Improvement:**
   - Evaluates the model's performance on the validation set.
   - Makes predictions and compares them to ground-truth labels.
   - Visualizes predictions and confidence levels.
   - Experiments with hyperparameters and techniques to improve accuracy.

4. **Saving and Sharing the Model:**
   - Saves the trained model for future use in `.h5` format or as a TensorFlow SavedModel.
   - Provides instructions for loading the saved model to make predictions or for fine-tuning.

## Key Features

- **Transfer Learning:** Accelerates training by utilizing a pre-trained model.
- **Local or Cloud Support:** The project can be run in any local environment (e.g., VS Code, Jupyter Notebook) or cloud platforms (e.g., Google Colab).
- **TensorBoard:** Visualizes model performance and training progress.
- **Early Stopping:** Prevents overfitting and reduces unnecessary training time.
- **Data Visualization:** Includes functions to visualize input data, predictions, and confidence levels.
